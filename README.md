# AI-Trainer-Project

This project is a AI based fitness training. Recently lot of people facing many health issues due to the lack of physical activity. Not getting enough physical
activity can lead to heart disease, even for people who have no other risk factors. It can also increase the likelihood of developing other heart disease risk factors,
including obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol.

In the pandemic social distancing is the big factor, so many workout center are closed. So peoples doing training at home. But there is no a trainer. 

In the absence of trainer workouts may lead to serious problems.

This project is help you a as trainer at home.It gives the message have doing workout properly and gives how many times you have done your workout.


In this project we will be building an AI Trainer using OpenCV and Python. We will use the pose estimation running on the CPU to find the correct
points and using these points we will get the desired angles. Then based on these angles we find many gestures including the number of biceps curls. 
We will write the code in a way that you will be able to find angles between any 3 points with just a single line of code.
